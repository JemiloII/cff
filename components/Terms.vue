          <h4>ACTIVITY AND ASSOCIATED RISKS</h4>
          <p>
            I have chosen to participate in Boffer Fighting, (hereinafter referred to as “the Sport”) which is organized
            by Convention Foam Fighting. (hereinafter referred to as “CFF”).
          </p>

          <p>I understand that:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The Sport is inherently hazardous, and I may be exposed to dangers and hazards, including some of the
              following: Lacerations, slips, falls, broken bones, fractures, concussions, head/eye injuries, brain damage,
